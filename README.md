# urc2022
This repository contains all of the codes that were deployed on the rover for URC 2022 and ARC 2022. This includes codes for drive, arm manipulation, capturing of sensor data, capturing of panoramic photographs, and many more miscellaneous functions of the rover.

Here are some videos of our rover running on this very same codebase!
